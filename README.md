Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN

Overview:
Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN is an AI-powered application designed to detect lung cancer from medical images such as CT scans and X-rays. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the tool aids in early diagnosis by classifying lung images as cancerous or non-cancerous with high accuracy.

Features:
ðŸ§  Deep Learning Model: Accurate detection using advanced CNN architecture.

ðŸ“ˆ High Accuracy: Optimized with techniques like data augmentation and normalization.

ðŸ’» Web-Based Interface: Easy-to-use interface for uploading and analyzing images.

ðŸ“Š Prediction Confidence: Displays results with confidence scores and visual highlights.

ðŸ“‚ Export Results: Save predictions and reports for further analysis.
